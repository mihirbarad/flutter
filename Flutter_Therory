Flutter Structure:

Myapp(Top-level)
	|
--MeterialApp
	|	
--MyHomepage

--Scaffold--
	|
1)appbar  2)body

Flutter Scaffold ::

Scaffold is a widget in flutter used to implement the basic material design visual layout structure,

it is quick qnough to create a general -purpose mobile application and contains almost everything we need to implement
create a functional and responsive Flutter apps, 

It is mainly responsible for creating a base to the app screen on which the child widgets hold on and render on the screen.

It provider many widgets or apis for showing drawer, snakbar BottomNavigatorbar , Appbar Floating action button, and many more,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appbar: The
It is horizontal bar that is mainly dispalyed at the top of the Scaffold widget,

Is is the main part of the Scaffold widget and dispalys at the top  of screen.


syntex:

return scaffold(
	appbar:AppBar(
		title:Text("My application")
	)
)

Conttainer:

Container is flutter is parent widget that can contain multiple child widgets and manage them efficiently.
through width , height and padding background color  etc.

it allows many attributes to the user for decorating its child widgets such as using margin which separates the container from
with other contents.

A container widgets is same as <div> tag in html, If this widgets does not cotain and child widgets. it will the 
whole aera on the screen automatically. otherwise is will wrap the child widget according to thespecified height andwidth



widget cannot render directly without any parent widgets, We can use Scaffold widgets. center widgets padding and
Row widgets or column widgets as its parent widgets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USe of Container:

Widgets that need some background styling may be a color shape , or size constraint we may try to wrap it in a widget
a container widget. this widget helps us to compose decorate and position its child wiidgets. This
if we wrap our widgets in a container then without using any parameters we would not notice any difference in the
But if we add any property such as color margin padding and etc. in a container , we can style our widgets on the same
screen accoring to our needs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Properties oF Container widgets: 

Child: This property is used to store the child widgetof the container. This

body: Container(
    child: Text("Container widget", style:Textstyle(fontsize:24))
)

color: background color of the entire container


home: scaffold(appbar:Appbar(title: Text("My App"), 
backgroundColor: color.cyan[300]))
body:Container(
    color:Colors.cyan[800]
    child:Text("hello welcome ", style: Textstyle(fontsizez:24))
)


Height and width :
By default the container always taks the space on its child widgets. 

body: Container(width: 500,
alignment: Alignment.center,
child:Text("Hello welcome")
)


margin: This Project is used to surround the empty space around the container edgeinsets all(25): set the equal 
margin in all four directions. 

body:Container(width: 500,
margin:EdgeInsets.all(25),
child:Text("Hello welcome"),
)

padding: set the distance between the border of the container (all four directions) and its child 
widget. 

	body: Container(width:500.
	padding: EdgeInsets.all(35)
	child:Text("Hello would",style:Textstyle(fontsize:30))
	)

	Alignment:This property is used to set the position of chilld within the container . Flutter 
	allows the user to align its element in various ways such as center bottom bottomcenter. etc. 

	alignment:Alignment.bottom.bottomcenter,

	Transform: The transformation property allows developers to ratate the container.
	it can rotate the container in any directions, i.e change the container coordinates
	in the prant widget,  

	ex:  Container(transform:Matrix4.rorationz(0.5))


	---------------------------------

	type of widget : There are two of widgets.
		1)Visible(input-Output)
		2)Invisible(Layout -control)
		
	visible widget  

	Text: A text widget hold some text to display on the screen. we can align the text widgets 
	uusing textalign property and style property allows the customization of text that include font 
	font weight and font style letter spacing.

	container(
		child:Text("Hello welcome to flutter ")
	)


	InVisible widget : invisible widget are related to the layout and control of widget
	controlling how the widget actually behave and how they will look onto the screen. we

	column: 

	A column widget is a type of widget that arrange all its children widget in a vertical layout
	alignment

	it provider spacing between the widget by using the mainaxixalignment
	and cross alignment property.

	in these property, the main axis is the vertical axis and the cross the horizontal 




	Row: Row widgets is similar to the column widget, but it constructs  a widget horizontally rather
	than vertically. 

	Here, The main axis is the horizontal axis, and the cross axis is the vertical axis ,

	Syntax:  

	new row(
		mainAxisAlignment: MAinerAxisAlignment.center,
		children:[
			new Text("msg")
			new Text("msg")
			new Text("msg")
		]
	)


	Type of Layout Widgets 
	1)Single Child widgets
	2)Multiple Child widgets
	3)Silver widgets

	Single Child Widgets: 

		single child layout widget is a type of widget, which can have only one child widget inside the parent layout
		widgets. These widgets can also contain special layout functionality. Flutter provides us many single widgets to make the app ui 
		attractive if we use these widgets appropriately, it can save out time and make the app code more readble .
